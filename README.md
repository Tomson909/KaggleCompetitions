# KaggleCompetitions

With this project I want to participate for 12 Months at each monthly Kaggle competition and create a good fundamental understanding of mainly traditional machine learning algorithms. So this directory serves to track my archievements and motivate me to work daily on these problems.

This directory is structured in the following way:
 ```
Kaggle-Competition/
│
├── Competition-Name-1/
│   ├── v1_submission.ipynb
│   ├── v2_submission.ipynb
│   ├── ...
│   └── final_submission.ipynb
│
├── Competition-Name-2/
│   ├── v1_submission.ipynb
│   ├── ...
│   └── final_submission.ipynb
│
└── ...

```
