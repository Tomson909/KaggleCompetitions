# KaggleCompetitions

With this project I want to participate for 12 Months at each monthly [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/hellotomtom) competition and create a good fundamental understanding of mainly traditional machine learning algorithms. So this directory serves to track my archievements and motivate me to work daily on these problems.

This directory is structured in the following way:
 ```
KaggleCompetition/
│
├── Competition-Name-1/
│   ├── v1_submission.ipynb
│   ├── v2_submission.ipynb
│   ├── ...
│   └── final_submission.ipynb
│
├── Competition-Name-2/
│   ├── v1_submission.ipynb
│   ├── ...
│   └── final_submission.ipynb
│
└── ...

```

## How to use this directory
Each subdirectory contains my submissions and models I used to fullfill the problem. The models are enumerated, so you can comprehend my journey on creating my best model. There is always a 'final' submission file which contains my best performing model. The directorys also contain **Dash** dashboard, because having an interactive way to explore the data improves the understanding a lot compared to traditional non interactive plots.

## Usage

Feel free to get **inspired** and also use the code if you want. Have fun:)
